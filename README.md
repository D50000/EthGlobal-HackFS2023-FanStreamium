# FanStreamium Project Description

## Introduction

FanStreamium is a brand new Web3 video streaming and membership subscription (NFT) video platform, coupled with an integrated web3 database aggregation platform for data management. FanStreamium consists of two sub-projects: the video platform and the data aggregation platform.

## Video Platform

The core functionality of the video platform is to create a live broadcast platform using Livepeer technology, combined with NFT technology, allowing broadcasters to sell private videos. The platform will design two types of NFTs, one for viewing private videos and a more expensive one, allowing holders to use Huddle01 for one-on-one video calls with broadcasters. Users can enter the broadcaster's live broadcast channel through ENS, while the broadcaster can use Push Protocol for message pushing.

## Data Aggregation Platform

The data aggregation platform can integrate data from different platforms and display them. Including IPFS video data, as well as Ceramic and Tableland data. The platform will also use Push Protocol to push messages and use ENS for domain management.
